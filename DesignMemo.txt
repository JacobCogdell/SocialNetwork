I had some trouble starting with the COMPSV-Assignment9 template (the option to use the template wasn't showing).  So I started from last
week's template and then added the social_network.py and README.md files with the starter code.

This week's assignment focuses on the graph data structure.  It takes advantage of the dictionary functionality to make it easy 
to establish bi-directional relationships between people.  This is what makes it different than the way we have used lists and 
trees.  Those structures would not have had as efficient look ups and the relationships are oriented around one way relationships 
The ability to have a key based on a person's name allows us to quickly add relationships to that person.  For a list, you would 
have to touch each element to find a person and for a tree, you would have to search.  I found that the performance was very quick 
and seems to be efficient.  The design is structurally limited in that it does not support name collisions which would happen in a 
larger data set.  

The past several assignments work together to establish a pattern of working code with a class representing the data and a class 
that manages or acts upon the data.  I really like this approach as it helps me to directly compare the different approaches 
and data structures.
